(Fork of) Macai
====

macai (macOS AI) is a simple yet powerful native macOS AI chat client that supports most AI providers: ChatGPT, Claude, xAI (Grok), Google Gemini, Perplexity, Ollama, OpenRouter, and almost any OpenAI-compatible APIs. [original README.md](README2.md)

## This is a personal fork where I'm experimenting with adding iOS support and Apple Foundation Models support. The current code quality isn't polished enough for a pull request yet.

### what changed
- Add iOS target
- Remove outdated dependency *Text
- Use [tuist](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/) to manage project

### // TODO
- Adding Apple Foundation Models (_iOS 26+,macOS 26+_)
